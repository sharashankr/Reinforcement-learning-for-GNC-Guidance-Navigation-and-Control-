The project aims to achieve a lunar landing using reinforcement learning instead of traditional aerospace methods. Since real rocket training isn't practical, the focus is on creating a realistic simulator. This involves building the simulator, selecting the right algorithm, and optimizing hyperparameters, starting with a lunar lander environment.
